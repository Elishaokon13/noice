# Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a Chrome extension that automatically posts a user's tweets from X (Twitter) to Farcaster. The extension should work for a single user (the installer), leverage the $5k X API Pro plan, and provide a seamless onboarding flow that includes Farcaster signup (or account connection) after X OAuth. The extension should be low friction, ideally supporting mobile tweeting as well, and should be 'set and forget.' If content on Farcaster performs well, users can earn tips. The primary outcome is to onboard new users to Farcaster.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Handling X (Twitter) OAuth and API integration securely in a Chrome extension.
- Automating tweet detection and cross-posting with minimal user friction.
- Integrating Farcaster sign-up and authentication within the extension.
- Ensuring the extension works for both desktop and mobile (bonus: mobile X app support).
- Providing a simple onboarding flow for new and existing Farcaster users.
- Handling rate limits, errors, and edge cases (e.g., deleted tweets, failed posts).
- Ensuring user privacy and security, especially with API tokens.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Research Feasibility and APIs**
   - Success: Documented notes on X API, Farcaster API, and Chrome extension capabilities for automation and OAuth.
2. **Chrome Extension Boilerplate Setup**
   - Success: Minimal extension loads in Chrome, with popup and background script.
3. **X (Twitter) OAuth Integration**
   - Success: User can authenticate with X and grant necessary permissions.
4. **Farcaster Onboarding Flow**
   - Success: After X OAuth, user is prompted to sign up for or connect a Farcaster account.
5. **Tweet Detection and Cross-Posting Logic**
   - Success: Extension detects new tweets by the user and posts them to Farcaster automatically.
6. **Mobile Support Research and Implementation (Bonus)**
   - Success: Documented and, if possible, implemented a way to support X mobile app tweets.
7. **User Settings and 'Switch On/Off' Toggle**
   - Success: User can enable/disable auto-posting and view status in the extension popup.
8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Success: All flows tested, edge cases handled, and debug info included in output.
9. **Documentation and Packaging**
   - Success: README and onboarding instructions for new users.

# Current Status / Progress Tracking

## Implementation Complete

The extension has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. Chrome Extension:
   - Manifest V3 configuration
   - Popup UI with account management
   - Background script for OAuth and cross-posting
   - Secure token storage

2. Backend Servers:
   - Twitter OAuth callback server
   - Farcaster cross-posting server
   - Rate limit handling
   - Error management

3. Features:
   - X (Twitter) OAuth integration
   - Farcaster authentication
   - Automatic tweet detection
   - Media attachment support
   - Mobile tweet support via polling
   - Enable/disable functionality
   - Real-time status updates

4. Documentation:
   - README with setup instructions
   - API configuration guide
   - Security considerations

## Next Steps

1. Testing:
   - Test X OAuth flow
   - Test Farcaster authentication
   - Test cross-posting functionality
   - Test error handling
   - Test rate limit handling

2. Deployment:
   - Package extension for Chrome Web Store
   - Set up production servers
   - Configure environment variables

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Implementation is complete. The extension is ready for testing with the following components:

1. Extension UI:
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Clear status indicators
   - Account management controls

2. Authentication:
   - Secure OAuth implementation
   - Token storage in Chrome storage
   - Automatic token refresh

3. Cross-posting:
   - Automatic tweet detection
   - Media handling
   - Rate limit management
   - Error handling

4. Documentation:
   - Setup guide
   - Usage instructions
   - API configuration

Next steps would be to:
1. Test the implementation with real X and Farcaster accounts
2. Set up production servers
3. Package for Chrome Web Store

# Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
- Keep API keys and secrets server-side for security.
- Use Chrome's extension storage for secure token management.
- Handle rate limits and errors gracefully.
- Provide clear user feedback for all operations.
